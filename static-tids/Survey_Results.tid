title: 2016 Skills and Technologies Survey Results

With over 25 years of experience as a contractor, consultant, and trainer in the software industry, [[Joe Welinske|http://www.welinske.com/about-joe-welinske/]] is certainly an expert in software user assistance and usability. Joe also maintains the [[WritersUA website and blog|http://www.welinske.com/]].

Recently, Joe published the results of the [[2016 Skills and Technologies survey|http://www.welinske.com/skills-and-technologies-survey-2016/]]. This survey was open to anyone in the Technical Communication and software user assistance fields, and it captured respondents' feedback on skills, technologies, and platforms.

Joe breaks the results out into four separate pages:

* [[The home page|http://www.welinske.com/skills-and-technologies-survey-2016-skills/]]

* [[Skills results|http://www.welinske.com/skills-and-technologies-survey-2016-skills/]]

* [[Technologies results|http://www.welinske.com/skills-and-technologies-survey-2016-technologies/]]

* [[Platform results|http://www.welinske.com/skills-and-technologies-survey-2016-platforms/]]

Why is this important? It helps shed light on where these professions currently are regarding these areas, and where these professions are trying to go with the rapid emergence of technologies like mobile devices, the Internet of Things (~IoT), Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR), and many others. It helps those of us in these fields identify which skills and tools we need in order to develop quality user assistance for an ever-growing online, on-demand customer base. It can also help identify which technology sectors may be job booms in the next 3-5 years. 

I recommend starting with the home page to get an overall understanding of the survey's scope, and then checking out the results pages. Knowing what those of us currently out in the field are identifying as important, potentially career-shaping skills and technologies can help you make important decisions on future studies, choices of internships, and job opportunities.
