title: Automated Documentation

The September issue of //Intercom//, the monthly periodical published by the Society for Technical Communication (STC), features several articles on automating documentation. Linking continuous documentation with continuous development and automating as much of the process as possible is a newer trend in this field. It is also one that I do not know much about. I will need to learn soon as the company I work for is transitioning from a thick client/workstation installation to cloud deployment. This transition will force the Tech Pubs group that I work in to reevaluate not only how we write content, but how we publish it, and how it is then distributed and disseminated. 

Here is [[a link to an article from Intercom on generating API documentation straight from the source|C:\Users\johnfrei4\Documents\SUNYIT\Tiddlywiki\contributions]] using three commonly-used tools: Doxygen, Javadoc, and Swagger. 

In addition to learning how to create API documentation from the source code, what I like most about this article is it discusses the need for cross-functional collaboration among different work groups.
