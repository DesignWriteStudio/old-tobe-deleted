title: Using Swagger to Make API Documentation Interactive

My current employer is a software development company in the access control/security industry. Previous employers have been split between hardware and software with more of a lean toward hardware. So, software terminology like SOAP, Git, API, and Swagger are fairly new to me. The developers I work with use <a href="https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification">Swagger</a> (now known as the OpenAPI specification) to develop and test APIs. I have had some exposure to it and the user guide that my team maintains, but I am by no means an expert with Swagger.

Tom Johnson, a technical  writer located in San Jose, California, has a lot more experience with Swagger and documenting APIs than I do. In his blog, <a href="http://idratherbewriting.com/">Iâ€™d Rather be Writing</a>, he wrote <a href="http://idratherbewriting.com/pubapis_swagger_intro/">an article about his experiences with Swagger</a>. In it, he discusses how Swagger helps make interactive documentation. I found it helpful in defining Swagger, APIs, REST, etc. I also liked his analogy to DITA and structured authoring (something I have a little more familiarity with).

What do you think?
